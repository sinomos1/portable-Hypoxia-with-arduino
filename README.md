# Hypoxia-project
-----------------
- Oxygen Measurements Using Groove oxygen sensors and Arduino DUO
-Relay setup for switching the actuator speed according to setpoint 
-Setpoints  where 5-7% . Ther program has been reaching tyhe setpoint with a 0.001% error due to sensor resolution and accurancy.
-Capture of data can be done with any serial port at 9600
-Liquid LCD 16/2 has been used with the external modulator to minimize the number of pins used . 
-LCD connection pins : SDA SCL GND VCC 
-need of a two way switch for setpoints 
>(Use external power supply for the sensor ->5 volts and try to keep it as isolated as possible from the overall arduino circuitry, to avoid noise)
